4-Bit Prime Number Detector Circuit

Designed a circuit to detect prime numbers between 0-15 using 5 AND gates, 1 OR gate, and NOT gates. Implemented a 4-bit binary input system, with outputs determined by AND gate combinations (e.g., A NOT, B NOT, C inputs) feeding into an OR gate. A speaker turns on for prime numbers, based on a truth table and K-map analysis, highlighting skills in logic circuit design and implementation.
